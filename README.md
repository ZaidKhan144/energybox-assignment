I like Trains, and now you do too!

Let's use the WMATA open API to visualize some live train data. Don't feel obligated to spend any more than 2-5 hours on this-- you're welcome to spend more time if you're having fun.

Getting Started

- You'll have to sign up for an account: https://developer.wmata.com/signup/
- Subscribe to the basic developer subscription: https://developer.wmata.com/Products -> default tier -> add subscription ( it's free, don't worry.)
- The API can be found at: https://developer.wmata.com/docs/services/ -> Train Positions
- There's also a demo key available at: https://developer.wmata.com/Products

API to use: Train Positions API

Tech to use: React and Javascript!

Don't know any React? Head to the react docs: https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html

Feel free to use CRA as a base for starting this project ( https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app )

DO NOT USE ANY NON-DEVELOPMENT DEPENDENCIES OTHER THAN THOSE INCLUDED IN CRA ( IE. NO using libraries/modules such as Lodash, Axios, Ramda, Material UI, Bootstrap etc. )

Try to complete the user stories below as best you can, and feel free to add in any features you'd like to see that may not be detailed here. The stories are purposefully vague and open to interpretation.
